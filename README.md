# Photo tools

Library of python tools that I use for my photography workflows.

## Install the photo tools package

Currently only installation form source is supported

```bash
pip intall .
```

This package needs [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed on the machine in order to use video commands or modules.
